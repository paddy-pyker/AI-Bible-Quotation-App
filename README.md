# AI Bible Quotation App

---

**A basic AI-powered Bible quotation app that listens to live sermons and displays Bible quotations in real-time.**

## Overview

---
**When the user taps the START button, the app streams voice to the server.
The server transcribes the audio using OpenAI Whisper (tiny model),
streams the transcription to Google Gemini Flash to extract a Bible quote address (if detected or implied),
queries a Bible database for the full quotation, and returns it for display.**

**The app is designed to be flexible and robust, allowing users to:**

* **Switch between different Bible versions, such as NIV, KJV, or NKJV, with simple voice commands (e.g., "Give me the NIV version")**


* **Handle explicit mentions of scriptures, scripture finding/quoting, and implicit mentions (e.g., "Next Verse") with ease, mimicking the experience of listening to a sermon**

**This allows users to seamlessly interact with the app and access their preferred Bible versions and scriptures in real-time.**
